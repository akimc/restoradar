Resto Radar
===========

Sinatra app powering <http://restoradar.com>

## Setup

Clone, create a [Foursquare app](https://foursquare.com/developers/apps) and stick the credentials in `.env` like so:

    FOURSQUARE_ID=L0TSAD1G1TSANDL3TT3RZ
    FOURSQUARE_SECRET=L0TSAD1G1TSANDL3TT3RZ

Then run:

    bundle install && gem install foreman
    foreman start

Enjoy!

## License

Don’t know what to write here… I guess you can fool around with the code
as you will. If you ever want to release something spinned off of it, I
would appreciate proper credits. :)
